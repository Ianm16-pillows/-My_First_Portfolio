  <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio Page</h1>
  <p>This is my very first attempt at creating a webpage. Itâ€™s simple, but every empire starts with a foundation â€” and this is mine.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Iâ€™m passionate about tech, growth, and building cool stuff. This webpage marks the beginning of my journey in web development.</p>

  <h3>Why Iâ€™m Learning Web Development</h3>
  <p>The web is where ideas meet the world. By mastering HTML, CSS, and beyond, Iâ€™ll be able to share my vision and projects with everyone, everywhere.</p>

  <p>Stick around, because this page will evolve as I learn more. Today itâ€™s paragraphs, tomorrow it might be full-stack applications. ðŸš€</p>
